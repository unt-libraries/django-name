    This will prevent two scenarios from occurring.
    1. Merging with a nonexistent Name object.

    2. Creating a loop of foreign key relationships.
        For example:
            Name 1 -> Name 2 -> Name 3 -> Name 1

        We need to prevent this because navigating to a name that has
        been merged with another, will redirect you to the Name it has
        been merged with.  If a loop is created, we will also create
        the opportunity for an HTTP redirect loop.

    Unlike typical Django validators, this requires a model instance
    as a parameter, instead of the value, which in this case would have
    been the ID of the related model.  Because of this requirement, this
    validator cannot be added via the `validator` kwarg on a ForeignKey
    field.  Rather this method should be called from the `clean` method.
