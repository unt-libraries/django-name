Introduction
============

About
-----

The Name App is a tool originally developed for documenting names by the UNT Libraries for use in its various digital library systems and collections. The app provides a consistent way of communicating the authorized version of a name and information about the name that is useful for reuse. The Name App generates a unique URL for each name that can be used to unambiguously refer to a person, organization, event, building or piece of software. In addition to an HTML page for each name there are a number of other formats available for each record including a MADS XML version and a simple JSON representation. A key feature of the Name App is the ability to link to other vocabularies such as the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), the Library of Congress Name Authority File, or Wikipedia.
